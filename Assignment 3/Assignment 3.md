Assignment 3

Objective:

Using ROS, control the rover through a host computer using the romipi_astar and romipi_teleop packages.



Procedure:

Unfortunately, my assignment did not end successfully, but using the following commands, I was able to at least set up my ROS and catkin envirornments as well as create the romipi_astar and romipi_teleop catkin packages. Unfortunately, running the roslaunch command only worked for the romipi_teleop package. The romipi_astar package had an error that did not allow it to communicate with the rover.
